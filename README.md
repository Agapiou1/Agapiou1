- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Agapiou1
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m using Elementor Pro for my website and from May 2021 I've had issues with pages that Google Console say are not mobile friendly" for 2 reasons.
the first reason is that "text is too small" and the second reason is that "clickable eleements are too close together".
I've clicked on each web page for both errors and then tested each live page as suggested by Google console only to find each page is confirmed to be 
"mobile friendy" by Google's own mobile friendly test ing tool.
I have made lots of changes to the webpages affected including increasing text size to 22px, checked that viewport is scaled to "1" in each case and have made 
sure Headings have <br> points to enure long headings fit on a mobile screen and more.
But whatever I do doesn't seem to work. It's very frustaing because the Google mobile test tool tells me everything is ok - then as I've said, Google then say 
the problem isn't fixed after resubmission.
I'm hoping this is an easily solvable problem and that I'm missing something that someone more experienced than myself on Github can solve, but I'm totally
frustrated with the problem.

Here a few of the web pages affected by the problem if anyone can find the time to look :-

https://www.falmouthbayholidayapartments.co.uk/holiday-accommodation-falmouth/
https://www.falmouthbayholidayapartments.co.uk/disabled-friendly-holiday-apartment-in-falmouth-cornwall/

Many thanks in advance if anyone can offer some advice.

Regards

John
